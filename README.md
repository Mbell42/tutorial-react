I will follow the official react tutorial to produce a tic-tac-toe game.

## Description

After following the tutorial, I have created a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe, indicates when a player has won the game, stores a game’s history a game progresses, and allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
